# Overview of Features
DEVELOPMENT REVIEW: WOULD A TOPIC ON THIS SUBJECT BE VALUABLE? IF SO, PLEASE PROVIDE THE CONTENT.

This section might contain a summary, even a bullet-point summary, of key features of the offering. Without growing too lengthy, the section might give a basic description of what each feature does, and perhaps how to navigate to it. Sometimes it might make sense to combine "Getting Started" with "Overview of Features" in the document, but conceptually it is good to identify them separately, because they can be chunked differently in Bluemix.

Keeping the principle of "progressive disclosure" in mind, this section might give additional detail about items covered in the "Getting Started" section.
